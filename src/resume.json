    "summary": "Graduated from Bloc.io's full stack apprenticeship that teaches both frontend and backend technologies. Grew up in the 90's and have always been fascinated by unique user interfaces and emerging technologies. From Tamogochi's, Nintendo 64's, and T-mobile sidekicks, new tech has always amazed me. Seeing how people, communities and habits change through tech is an enlightening experience. I want to be able to use software and the web to assist business, people, and communities at large.",

Firebase would be our backend database, and Angular would be the framework for the HTML, CSS, and logic of the application. The fun part of this object was seeing objects such as chat rooms and messages. I also had fun styling this project to look similar to modern chat applications such as Slack. The difficult part of this project was using a cookie to store the username and attaching the message to that username. In the end I was able to chat with friends easier",
